/system/ directory build instructions
=====================================

The /system/ directory available on the sturgeon platform and provided in prebuilt
form by android_sturgeon-lp.bb is a tricky mix of an original Android Wear /system
and some recompiled parts. This is due to the half-closed nature of Android
Wear. This file explains you how to rebuild manually your own /system dir.

We first need to adb pull a /system directory from a living Android Wear 5.0.1
installation and then modify it with some symlinks:
  adb pull /system/ system
  cd system/
  rm -rf app/ fonts/ framework/ media/ priv-app/ xbin/
  sed -i "/persist.hwc.mdpcomp.enable=true/d" build.prop
  cd vendor/lib/egl/
  ln -s libGLESv2_adreno.so libGLESv2S3D_adreno.so
  cd ../../../lib/hw/
  ln -s hwcomposer.msm8226.so hwcomposer.sturgeon.so
  ln -s gralloc.msm8226.so gralloc.sturgeon.so
  ln -s memtrack.msm8226.so memtrack.sturgeon.so
  cd ../../../

We also need the firmware files for the ADSP. We can also pull the /firmware
directory from a living Android Wear 5.0.1 installation:
  adb pull /firmware/ firmware
  cp -r firmware/image/* system/vendor/firmware/

This installation wouldn't be enough because libhybris needs a patched bionic
and the GPU drivers also need to be recompiled on the QCOM platform with the 
QCOM_BSP flag. Thankfully, those specific parts are open-source so we can 
download and then build them. (This may take a while)
  ### Download
  curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo
  chmod a+x repo
  mkdir -p android-sturgeon/
  cd android-sturgeon
  # For now the repo manifest is pretty much sturgeon-specific, maybe we should
  # split/merge branches later?
  ../repo init -u https://github.com/AsteroidOS/android_manifest
  ../repo sync

  ### Build (can only be done in bash)
  . build/envsetup.sh
  export TARGET_USES_C2D_COMPOSITION=true # Needed by copybit
  export TARGET_USES_QCOM_BSP=true        # Fixes GPU problems on QCOM platforms
  export TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM=msm8226    # We Specify the SoC by hand

  mmma hardware/qcom/display/msm8226/     # hwcomposer, gralloc, dependencies...
  mmma frameworks/native/cmds/servicemanager/
  mmma system/core/logd/
  mmma system/core/init/

  If you get an error like "linux/msm_kgsl.h: No such file or directory", edit
  hardware/qcom/display/msm8226/common.mk and add this line:
  
  common_includes += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../../msm8x26/kernel-headers/

  ### Installation
  cp out/target/product/generic/root/init ../system/bin/
  cp -r out/target/product/generic/system/bin/* ../system/bin/
  chmod +x ../system/bin/*

  cp -r out/target/product/generic/system/usr/* ../system/usr/
  mkdir -p ../usr/libexec/hal-droid/system/lib/
  cp -r out/target/product/generic/system/lib/* ../usr/libexec/hal-droid/system/lib/
  rm -r ../usr/libexec/hal-droid/system/lib/hw/
  cp -r out/target/product/generic/system/lib/hw/* ../system/lib/hw/


libhybris headers
=================

The second part of this tarball contains header files to compile against
libhybris. There is a script in the libhybris distribution that can pull
the header files from the downloaded android distribution (above).

  git clone https://github.com/libhybris/libhybris
  ./libhybris/utils/extract-headers.sh android-sturgeon include

With the system and include directories, you can create the system-dir tarball:

  tar zcvf system-5.1.1-LCB43B.tar.gz system include usr
