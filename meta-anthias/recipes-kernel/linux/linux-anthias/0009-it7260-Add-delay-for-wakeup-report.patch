Subject: [PATCH] it7260: Add delay for wakeup report. AsteroidOS requires the
 user to keep pressing the screen for ~200ms to wake the screen. However, the
 method used here simply sends a quick event, which doesn't work in our
 implementation. To solve this we simply need to make sure the the finger is
 held down for at least 200ms, this is done by emulating a 300ms touch.
