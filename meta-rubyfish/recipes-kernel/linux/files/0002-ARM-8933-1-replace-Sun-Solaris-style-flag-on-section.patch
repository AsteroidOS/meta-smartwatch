Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 8933/1: replace Sun/Solaris style flag on section
 directive
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It looks like a section directive was using "Solaris style" to declare
the section flags. Replace this with the GNU style so that Clang's
integrated assembler can assemble this directive.

The modified instances were identified via:
$ ag \.section | grep #
