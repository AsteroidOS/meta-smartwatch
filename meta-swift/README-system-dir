/system/ directory build instructions
=====================================

The /system/ directory available on the dory platform and provided in prebuilt 
form by android_dory-lp.bb is a tricky mix of an original Android Wear /system
and some recompiled parts. This is due to the half-closed nature of Android
Wear. This file explains you how to rebuild manually your own /system dir.

We firt need to adb pull a /system directory from a living Android Wear 5.1.1
installation and then modify it with some symlinks:
  adb pull /system/ system
  sed -i "/persist.hwc.mdpcomp.enable=true/d" system/build.prop
  cd system/vendor/lib/egl/
  ln -s libGLESv2_adreno.so libGLESv2S3D_adreno.so
  cd ../../../lib/hw/
  ln -s hwcomposer.msm8226.so hwcomposer.dory.so
  ln -s gralloc.msm8226.so gralloc.dory.so
  ln -s memtrack.msm8226.so memtrack.dory.so
  cd ../../../

This installation wouldn't be enough because libhybris needs a patched bionic
and the GPU drivers also need to be recompiled on the QCOM platform with the 
QCOM_BSP flag. Thankfully, those specific parts are open-source so we can 
download and then build them. (This may take a while)
  ### Download
  curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo
  chmod a+x repo
  mkdir -p android-dory/
  cd android-dory
  # For now the repo manifest is pretty much dory-specific, maybe we should 
  # split/merge branches later?
  ../repo init -u https://github.com/Asteroid-Project/android_manifest
  ../repo sync

  ### Build (can only be done in bash)
  . build/envsetup.sh
  export TARGET_USES_C2D_COMPOSITION=true # Needed by copybit
  export TARGET_USES_QCOM_BSP=true        # Fixes GPU problems on QCOM platforms
  export TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM=msm8226    # We Specify the SoC by hand
  mmma hardware/qcom/display/msm8226/     # hwcomposer, gralloc, dependencies...
  mmma frameworks/native/cmds/servicemanager/
  mmma system/core/logd/
  mmma system/core/init/

  ### Installation
  cp out/target/product/generic/root/init ../system/bin/
  cp out/target/product/generic/system/* ../system/
